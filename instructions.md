# Deep Learning for Visual Computing - Assignment 3

The third assignment encourages you to experiment with deep learning for tasks **other than** image classification. The task is simple: do something with deep learning that is not image classification and write about your findings. You don't have to train any models or code anything (unless you want to), simply use code from the Internet. You don't have to use Pytorch either. [This link](https://paperswithcode.com/sota) should get you started, but you can also search for other projects on Github or elsewhere. The only requirement is that the code is open source.

Aim for a total effort of around 15 hours including getting the code to run and writing the report. This should be enough time for quite detailed experiments of a single task (Maybe comparing YOLO with other object detectors, experimenting with GANs, or evaluating different semantic segmentation architectures. - Stick to computer vision problems!).  Be aware that it is easy to choose a project that is harder to complete than expected. If you're using code from Github, the number of stars a repository has is a good metric to pay attention to. We also recommend that you look for repositories that are actively maintained to avoid errors due to mismatched package versions. 

## Report

Write a short report (3 to 4 pages) that answers the following questions:

* What did you do?
* Where did you download the code (including links)? Did you change anything and (if so) what?
* Did you have problems running the code? If so, how did you fix them?
* Which tests did you perform and what are the results? Discuss the results and include images and figures.

## Submission

Submit your assignment until **June 30th at 11pm**. To do so, create a zip archive including the report and all the code. More precisely, after extracting the archive we should obtain the following:

    group_x/
        report.pdf
        src/
            ...

Submit the zip archive in TUWEL. Make sure you've read the general assignment information [here](https://smithers.cvl.tuwien.ac.at/jstrohmayer/dlvc_ss22/-/blob/main/assignments/general.md) before your final submission.
